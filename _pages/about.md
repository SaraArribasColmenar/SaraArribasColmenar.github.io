Sara Arribas Colmenar, lecture at Christopher Newport University, is specialized in early 20th-century Spanish literature, dance, and performance. Her interdisciplinary research explores the intersections between literature, performance, and visual culture, with a focus on gender studies, social network analysis, and archival approaches. Sara's dissertation, "Constelaciones de Artistas: Estudio de los Espacios de Creación Colaborativa y Análisis de Redes en Espectáculos y Circuitos Intelectuales Españoles (1909-1936)," explores the intricate networks of writers, choreographers, composers, and visual artists in early 20th-century Spain. By using social network analysis and digital humanities tools, she maps collaborative spaces such as the literary gatherings at Café Pombo, the Teatro del Arte theater company, the Residencia de Señoritas, the Ballets Espagnols dance company, and the Concurso del Cante Jondo (1922). Her research reveals how these interdisciplinary collaborations fostered artistic innovation and redefined women’s roles in the arts. Sara’s work uncovers how these intellectual and creative circles shaped Spain’s cultural landscape, emphasizing the significance of cross-disciplinary influences in literature, dance, and performance during this transformative period.

Holding a BA in Classical Philology from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Sara also completed a Master’s in Classics and a Master’s in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. She is currently pursuing a certification in Digital Humanities to further expand her expertise in this growing field. Moreover, she served as a Graduate Research Assistant of [Digital Liberal Arts at the Digital Pedagogies and Initiatives Office](https://digital.la.psu.edu/ ) , where she honed her skills in digital methodologies. Her digital work includes developing projects related to social network analysis, digital editions, and interactive timelines. During her time as a Visiting Scholar at the Centro Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) in Madrid, she deve;p[ed the digital project [Bailando la literatura](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1z04hQIYry_6GH_Fb4xw-2DtsaWdZgftWYLvZUbcOONk&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650), an interactive timeline that explores the connections between literature, dance, and performance in early 20th-century Spain. In addition, she was a Member of the [Seminario Complutense de investigación en Historia y Teoría de la danza](https://www.ucm.es/seminariohtdanza/) thanks to her Elemental Degree in Spanish Dance recognized by A.P.D.E (Asociación de Profesores de Danza Española). 

Beyond her research experience, Sara is deeply committed to innovative and inclusive teaching. She has taught a wide range of Spanish language courses at Penn State University, including introductory and intermediate levels (SPAN 001 and SPAN 003), as well as more advanced courses such as Advanced Grammar and Composition through short films (SPAN 200).  In each of these courses, Sara employs a student-centered approach, designing her lessons to actively engage students and encourage participation. By integrating digital tools such as Google Jamboard, StoryMapJS, and Canva, she enhances the learning experience, making it interactive and accessible for all proficiency levels. Sara’s dedication to fostering critical thinking and creativity has earned her the Teaching Excellence Award at Penn State

In addition to her research and teaching, Sara is actively involved in academic and community service. She has volunteered and participated in the Happy Valley Latin Festival, contributing to the celebration and promotion of Latinx and Hispanic culture in Central Pennsylvania. As a co-coordinator of the Latin American and Iberian Film Series at Penn State, she has curated and facilitated discussions on Spanish and Latin American films, engaging both students and the broader community in critical conversations about culture and society. She also leads flamenco workshops in collaboration with the Spanish Club, where her lessons not only share her passion for dance but also serve as fundraisers to support students with limited resources, helping them participate in study abroad programs.

Whether engaging with the academic community or creating inclusive cultural spaces, Sara is dedicated to enriching the lives of those around her, promoting a sense of belonging, and supporting the Latin Community. She strives to bridge the gap between academia and the community, creating spaces that foster meaningful cultural experiences and support students’ personal and academic growth.
