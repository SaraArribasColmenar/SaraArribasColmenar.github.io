Holding a BA in Classical Philology from Universidad Complutense de Madrid, she also completed a Master’s in Classics and  has  been a Member of the [Seminario Complutense de investigación en Historia y Teoría de la danza](https://www.ucm.es/seminariohtdanza/) thanks to her Elemental Degree in Spanish Dance recognized by A.P.D.E (Asociación de Profesores de Danza Española).
Sara is deeply engaged in research on dance and Spanish theater during the XX century, particularly focusing on the concept of the new women in movement and the reception of the public. Her work primarily involves the textual choreographies of Ramón Gómez de la Serna, exploring the intellectual circuits surrounding key figures such as Federico García Lorca, Los Sierra, and Tomás Borrás. Additionally, she is actively developing a digital project on social media networks using gephi.org This project aims to demonstrate the interconnectedness of dance and literature through the exploration of personal relationships among choreographers, musicians, set designers, and literary figures of the time.
