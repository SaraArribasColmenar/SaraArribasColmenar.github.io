At the heart of my teaching philosophy lies a profound respect and consideration for my students and their academic growth. It is my desire to create this type of atmosphere where students can meet their full potential. I will provide a safe environment where students are invited to share their ideas and take risks. I firmly believe that the cornerstone of effective teaching is the creation of a comfortable and welcoming environment. This is why I always greet my students with a smile and inquire about their well-being. From my experience, demonstrating humanity in the classroom helps students shed the pressure they may feel, allowing them to focus only on learning.

subtitle: Encouraging Mistakes

In my language classes, I emphasize the importance of making mistakes. I reassure my students that it's perfectly okay to err, but what's crucial is that they practice as much as possible and embrace their mistakes. I share with them that I am not a native English speaker myself and that I make mistakes too. However, this doesn't hinder my ability to communicate with others. It's through their errors that I can identify areas that need more focus, guiding my teaching strategy.

subtitle: Student-Centered Approach

My role in the classroom is to guide and support my students in learning as much as possible. I adapt to their needs and listen attentively, ensuring communication is a two-way street. This approach encourages them to engage actively in their learning process. For more advanced courses in literature and culture, I incorporate digital tools such as Jamboard. This digital whiteboard allows students to note down main ideas, facilitating discussion and collaborative learning.

subtitle: Incorporation of Technology

A key aspect of my teaching strategy is the integration of new technologies into learning. Besides Jamboard, I introduce my students to Canva, enabling them to design their learning journals. These journals serve as a space for reflection on the class content, fostering the development of critical thinking skills and expanding on classroom concepts.

Towards the end of the course, students are tasked with developing a project that might involve creating a digital map, an infographic, or a poster on a topic of their interest within the course framework. I support them every step of the way, ensuring they invest effort and creativity into their projects. This project not only culminates their learning experience but also empowers them to take ownership of their educational journey.

In summary, my teaching philosophy is centered around fostering a supportive and interactive learning environment, encouraging mistakes as learning opportunities, and utilizing technology to enhance educational outcomes. By listening to and adapting to my students' needs, I aim to guide them towards achieving their maximum potential.
