This coming Spring semester (2024), I will be starting a new adventure in Digital Liberal Arts at the Digital Pedagogies and Initiatives Office

---

I am very excited about this opportunity, as I will be able to develop my skills as a digital humanist. In addition, I am enthusiastic about contributing to the development of standard workflow templates and models. As a Research Assistant, I will not only help organize documentation for other digital projects, but I will also be able to work on developing my own research on digital social networks. This experience will allow me to learn a lot about what it means to be a digital humanist under the leadership of my mentor Dr. Jennifer Issasi.

#### Skills that I will develope:

<ul>
    <li>Data management</li>
    <li>Documenting digital projects for sustainability</li>
    <li>Organizing bibliography with Zotero</li>
    <li>Archive work with Tropy</li>
    <li>Digital social network analysis with Gephi</li>
    <li>Develope of standard workflow templates and models</li>
   
</ul>
