The project **Las cartas de Busa** is a digital edition carried out by the HD LAB of the IIBICRIT at CONICET, Argentina. It focuses on digitizing and organizing the letters of Father Roberto Busa, a pioneer in computational linguistics, making them accessible to the public.

I contributed by developing the code for the digitalization of some of the letters as part of the **Digital Humanities Certificate** from [UCES](https://www.uces.edu.ar/carreras-escuela-negocios/escuela-de-ciencias-de-psicologia-y-ciencias-sociales/diplomatura-humanidades-digitales).
